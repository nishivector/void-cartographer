# Void Cartographer

**Chart the Edges of Reality**

## Story/Lore

In the year 3402, humanity discovered that reality itself has "edges" — boundaries where physics breaks down and pure thought becomes manifest. You are a Void Cartographer, one of the few individuals who can navigate these liminal spaces. Your mission: chart the uncharted edges of existence before the Silence — an entity that consumes all mapped reality — reaches your home dimension.

The void is not empty. It pulses with geometric life, humming with unseen frequencies. Each edge world is a unique manifestation of thoughts that escaped into the unreality. Your mapping device — a Resonance Anchor — allows you to solidify these thoughts into stable points, creating a navigable path.

The Silence is patient. It waits at the edges of your vision, consuming everything you leave unmapped. Move too slowly, and it takes what you've built. Move too fast, and you may anchor unstable points that collapse into void rifts.
